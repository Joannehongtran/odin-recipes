    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook noodles according to package instructions, split between 4-5 bowls</li>
    </ol>

    <h4> <strong>SOUP</strong> </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Thinly slice shallots, add oil to a pan and saute until light brown.</li>
        <li>Add quartered tomatoes, stir fry for 3-5 minutes until slightly soft.</li>
        <li>Add shallots, tomatoes, and all remaining soup ingredients into a large pot.</li>
        <li>Raise to high heat until it hits a boil, and boils for five minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low or low, so it maintains a low boil while you work on the Riêu.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>RIÊU / MEATBALLS</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add shallots into a small food processor, pulse until finely chopped.</li>
        <li>Add shrimp, pulse 5-6 times.</li>
        <li>Add remaining ingredients (except crab and green onion) and pulse a few times until evenly mixed.</li>
        <li>Pour into a mixing bowl, add crab and lightly mix with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Using a soup spoon, scoop 1-2 tbsp size meat balls (your choice!) into the pot until you use it all</li>
        <li>Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil, then drop heat to a low boil. At most it should take 20 minutes to cook the meatballs all the way through. Check doneness by breaking a meatball in half to make sure its not soft or raw inside.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>SERVING</h4>  
    <ol>
        <li>Evenly divide contents of the soup pot between your 4-5 bowls.</li>
        <li>Serve a communal accoutrement plate on the side so each guest can customize their own.</li>
    </ol>
